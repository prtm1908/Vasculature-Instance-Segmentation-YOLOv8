# Vasculature-Instance-Segmentation-YOLOv8

This project aims to perform instance segmentation of blood vessels and glomerulus in medical images using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection and instance segmentation. The dataset used for this project is the "HuBMAP - Hacking the Human Vasculature" dataset, which is available on Kaggle. Instance segmentation is the task of detecting and delineating individual objects within an image, which in this case includes blood vessels and glomerulus structures.
